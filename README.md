#CBSE Result Fetcher

A PhantomJS script that fetches Class 12 results. You can use this to fetch your school results if you know the range of roll numbers.

First install [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org), then run `phantomjs script.js` in your terminal.

TODO:

1) Write all the results to a single CSV file

2) Make a JSON file of all the results and use d3.js to graph the general performance.
